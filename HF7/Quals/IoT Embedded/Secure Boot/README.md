# Secure Boot 1,2,3,4

Secure boot is a mechanism to protect a system against malicious code by ensuring only authenticated software runs on the device. Extending the authentication scheme from the bootloader to user space involves establishing a chain of trust. In this challenge you will analyze a boot image of an embedded device and try to break the chain of trust and gather secrets.
The image contains 4 flags. Go ahead and reveal the all ! 

Good Luck !
